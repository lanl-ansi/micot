# Description
Multi Infrastructure Control and Optimization Toolkit (MICOT)

MICOT is a tool for optimizing and controlling infrastructure systems. In includes modules for optimizing the operations of an infrastructure structure (for example optimal dispatch), designing infrastructure systems, restoring infrastructures systems, resiliency, preparing for natural disasters, interdicting networks, state estimation, sensor placement, and simulation of infrastructure systems. It implements algorithms developed at LANL that have been published in the academic community.

# Installation

## Maven Installation

MICOT is distributed as Maven project. To install MICOT as Maven project, follow these steps

1. Download [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and unzip the package into a location of your choice.
2. Update your PATH variable to point at the bin directory where the "mvn" executable is located
3. Download and install [Java 1.7 JDK (or later)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html).
4. [Update](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/) JAVA_HOME to point at directory of your Java installation.
5. Install a git tool
6. Download the repository using the following command ```git clone https://github.com/lanl-ansi/micot.git```
7. Build and package the code using the command ```mvn install -DskipTests``` from the top level directory of the git repository

### LANL Only
If you are behind the LANL firewall, you need to tell Maven where the proxyserver is.  In ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml add the following block (create settings.xml if it does not exist)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<settings xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0">
<proxies>
<proxy>
<id>lanlproxy</id>
<active>true</active>
<protocol>http</protocol>
<host>proxyout.lanl.gov</host>
<port>8080</port>
</proxy>
</proxies>
</settings>
```

The maven build does not compile code that depends on [cplex](https://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/). To build micot with cplex follow the steps provided in the CPLEX installation section below.

 
## Eclipse Installation

MICOT is distributed as an Eclipse project. To install MICOT as an eclipse project, follow these steps

1. Download and install [Java 1.7 JDK (or later)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html).
2. Download and install [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/ide/).
3. Install a git tool
4. Download the repository using the following command ```git clone https://github.com/lanl-ansi/micot.git```
5. Download [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and unzip the package into a location of your choice.
6. Update your PATH variable to point at the bin directory where the "mvn" executable is located
7. [Update](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/) JAVA_HOME to point at directory of your Java installation.
8. From the top directory of the Micot repository run ```mvn eclipse:eclipse```
9. Import the git project in Eclipse.  File -> Import -> Projects from Git -> Existing Local Repository
  * Sometimes you have Right click on the project in Eclipse and choose Maven -> Update Project

The eclipse project is configured to compile without cplex. To build micot with cplex follow the steps provided in the CPLEX installation section below.

## [Optional] DCOM Installation 

Some functionality of MICOT requires interactions with third-party software through the Windows DCOM protocols. To install the native libraries required to interact with DCOM, follow these instructions

### LANL
1. Install a git tool
2. Download the native libraries using the following command ```git clone https://github.lanlytics.com:rbent/micot-libraries.git```

### Outside LANL
1. Download the [Java Com bridge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/) version 1.18.
2. Add the directory where the file "jacob-1.18-x64.dll" is located to your PATH environment variable

## [Optional] CPLEX Installation

If you wish to configure MICOT to work with CPLEX to perform optimization of MILP problems, follow these steps.

1. Buy [cplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPLEX)
2. Remove 
  ```xml
  <plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
  <excludes>
  <exclude>**/cplex/*.java</exclude>
  </excludes>
  </configuration>
  </plugin>
  ``` 
  from pom.xml

3. Remove "excluding="**/cplex/*.java" in the line 
  ```xml
  <classpathentry excluding="**/cplex/*.java" kind="src" output="target/classes" path="src/main/java">
  ``` 
  of .classpath

### LANL
1. Download the native libraries using the following command ```git clone https://github.lanlytics.com:rbent/micot-libraries.git```
2. Add
  ```xml
  <classpathentry kind="lib" path="/micot-libraries/jars/cplex1263.jar"/>
  ```
  to .classpath
  * This step might have to be repeated during git updates 

### Outside LANL
1. Add
  ```xml
  <classpathentry kind="lib" path="/foo/cplex.jar"/>
  ```
  to .classpath, where foo is the location of your cplex.jar file
  * This step might have to be repeated during git updates 

## [Optional] SCIP Installation

1. Obtain a license for [SCIP](http://scip.zib.de/)

### LANL
1. Download the native libraries using the following command ```git clone https://github.lanlytics.com:rbent/micot-libraries.git```

### Outside LANL
1. Request the LANL C++ micot-scip bridge source code
2. Build the micot-scip native libraries using the provided Make file

### All

1. [Option 1] Add the directory where the micot native libraries reside to the PATH variable of your machine. For linux this is the location of scipLibrary.so. For windows this is the location of scipLibrary.dll. For mac this is the location of libscip.dylib.

2. [Option 2]
  * **Linux**
    1.  Confirm that /usr/local/bin appears in your PATH variable
    ```
    echo $PATH
    ```
    If it does, place scipLibrary.so in /usr/local/bin/ 
    ```
    sudo cp scipLibrary.so /usr/local/bin/
    ```
    2. Scip requires the following libraries  
    
    * libz.so.1
    * libgmp.so.10
    * libreadline.so.7 
    * libgfortran.so.4
    * libgcc_s.so.1
    * libc.so.6
    * ld-linux-x86-64.so.2. 
    
    Apt-get can be used to install these libraries with the following commands
    ```
    apt-get update
    apt-get -y upgrade
    apt-get -y install gcc g++ gfortran libreadline-dev libgmp-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses-dev make cmake wget
    ```
  * **Mac**
    1. Place the contents of scip/mac in /usr/local/lib/
    ```
    sudo cp scip/mac/* /usr/local/lib/
    ```
  *  **Windows**
    1. Unlike linux and mac, there is no default "local" directory for warehousing binaries. Best practices is to add the scip windows directory the PATH variable
      * Windows prefers that environment variables be modified through its GUI options
        1. Select Start, select Control Panel. double click System, and select the Advanced tab.
        2. Click Environment Variables. 
        3. In the Edit System Variable (or New System Variable) window, specify the value of the PATH environment variable. Append the scip directory by using the syntax ";scip_directory"
      * The alternative is modifying the PATH variable at the command line or batch script requries this command
      ```
      setx PATH "%PATH%;scip_directory
      ```
      * One could bypass the need to update the PATH variable by putting the windows scip libraries in %systemroot\system% (Windows 7), but that is not recommended.
